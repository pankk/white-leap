## Did the leap quantum?

All the following assumes that I've understood correctly what I've read and 
learned.
Quantum computing (QC) **could** solve "N=NP?" since QC has something to do
with Shor's algorithm which pwns prime factorization (help) and "Prime 
factorization [...] is widely believed to be NP-complete."[1] and "[...] if
anyone ever comes up with a polynomial-time solution to an NP-complete 
problem, that will also give a polynomial-time solution to any NP 
problem."[2]

So are we simply waiting for QC with enough qubits? Does it matter if it is
universal gate QC or quantum annealing QC?
